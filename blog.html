              <p>After I joined in VIT I was bit sacred of many because everything is not well aware for me. I have joined a club after the suggestion of a fellow seniour that I know. He also added joining a club also develops your  communication skills and fear of talking in front of a group.</p>
               <br>
              <p> So I decided and joined and participated in a street play representing a jawans and their efforts they put in saving mother land india on a eve of republic day. I was enthusiastic for playing a role in that play and totally enjoyed it. My dearest one's appreciated me after watching me play a role like that who is scared as hell to talk to a stranger. It is one of sweet memory to cherish for my life</p>

            </blockquote>
              <p>In my life, I have gone only few memorable trips. and it is one i can cherish I look forward to my families annual trip to vizag every year, and I will never forget our trip to Wonderla or all the different family events we’ve gone to out east. But the one trip that has stayed in my mind and had the greatest impact on me wasn’t a family trip.</p>
              <p>It was my youth group trip to Goa. Boy with bear mascot Me with a team mascot.Every year my temple youth group takes all it’s freshmen on a special trip to Goa, as part of their confirmation .</p>
              <p> We all got up early on a Friday and the bus departed at seven. After an exhaustingly long bus ride it was time for our first destination. We all got dressed up in our good clothes and arrived at a famous church in Goa.Actually it wasn’t a church. It was the first reformed as temple ever established in the world. The founders wanted to create a place of worship that was seemingly identical to the norm. The temple had an Ottoman-esque interior, roofed with elaborately painted domes, lined with traditional wooden pews, with a massive organ in the back that’s pipes snaked up the wall like ivy.Any confusion was suddenly swept away when we saw water come flowing into our room. A pipe had burst and we spent the night with an inch of water covering the floor.This trip was three years ago. But of it is still vivid in my memory. It instilled faith in me and built camaraderie amongst my peers (some are now my best friends) and it has given me memories that I will cherish forever.</p>
