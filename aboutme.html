              <p>I am Anand K S. A CSE undergraduate who is way too busy fighting with the challenges that life gives me. As a person, I tend to be someone who appears to be reserved in his own little world at first sight, but can prove to be a maniac once you get close enough. </p>
              <p>I tend to have a good intrest in music due to the fact that I have been trained in classical music for 9 years(<i>When you hear yourself sing the wrong notes for that long, you tend to enjoy good music</i>).</p>
              <p>I am interested in Competitve programming and is a member of Code at Amrita.</p>
              <p>P.S: Junk content is found so that the scroll menu's use is highlighted. Ghis page has turned out to be yet another blog</p>

              <p>I was born to a typical middle class family in Central Kerala to an engineer and a banker mom.My dad used to work abroad, but is now enjoying his late 50s at his own abode.  </p>
              <p>I am still confused whether this a boon or bane, I have a brother. Having a brother almost 10 years older than you means that he can be bossy like your parents but can also be kind enough to sign your report cards(<i>Yeah!the not so good ones</i>) or to get yourself some good pocket money or to be your lifeline or teacher on the day before exams.</p>
              <p>Most part of my childhood took place in the company of seven cousins who used to live close-by ensuring that boredom was not in my dictionary.(<i>Well,the latest edition do have that word. Education and job spread us apart</i>). My childhood was made awesome by my grandparents who turned out to be the reserve bank governer for my little wants and a masterchef candidate whenever my stomach pleased.</p>

            </blockquote>
              <p>I spent the first two years of my schooling in Sree narayana Vidyapeetham.And I dont remember even a tiniest bit about my life there</p>
              <p>I joined Chinmaya Vidyalaya Tripunithura once i got promoted to first grade. Life got exciting during the 12 years at that place. I made a lot of friends and we grew up together with our own little problems and ways to sort them out.</p>
              <p>As a group of naughty students and loving teachers, we found ourselves exploring horizons together and having a lot of fun in doing so.</p>
              <p>I was frightened on the first day of school when my mother turned her back on me and walked away, leaving me behind with a bunch of kids. On that day I never knew that i would be once sad when I leave those kids behind me.Just as all good things come to an end I graduated from high school in 2019</p>

            </blockquote> 
              <p>What i would do after school was always a question. I had interest in none of the things that undergraduation had to offer me. just like anyone with similar circumstances and un-hate(<i>I would never use the word love here</i>) for PCM, engineering was the default option.</p>
              <p>The hard part was that my family expected me to study hard for Jee.Fun fact: I never intended to.. And that was when i chance to stumble upon the aftermovie of Oasis(the annual cultural fest of BITSpilani). Yes! that is the place.I went onto watch a lot of Aftermovies, but none of them gave them the vibe Oasis gave(Not even IITB).</p>
              <p>Life was just another Daku-Mangal-Singh and i was no Chotta Bheem to fight what he has in store for me. I failed in JEE(expected and safe) and even more miserably in BITSAT(heartbroken). I made it to almost all the top colleges in Kerala. But having a brother whose life turned out to be well from a private University based in Coimbatore and a family who have a not so good approach towards KTU, I knew what exactly was coming for me</p>
              <p>I was trailing on my brothers footpaths and I joined Amrita University for Computer Science. Well, life today is not so bad at this new place. i have started making friends, and coping up with life away from home. If good things keep on happening, I am sure that life @ amrita is gonna be one hell of a fun and great ride</p>
